# Hey! I'm Rahul 😀
I like developing programs to automate tasks.<br />
My goal is to make my solutions:
1. **readable** 📗 and 
2. **scalable** 📏

But first, I need to [figure out Git and GitHub 😅](https://github.com/rahulsdas/learning_github)


<!---
rahulsdas/rahulsdas is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
